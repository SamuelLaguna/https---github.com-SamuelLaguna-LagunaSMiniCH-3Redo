Peer Review: Brandon Le - Good job on the project, but there are a few issues that prevent it from running properly. First just to point out a few good things, it was able to properly take users input and store the answers into the respective strings. I also liked how if the user entered in a specific food or football team, it had a personalized response for Samuel. An idea for this would be to user either .ToUpper or .ToLower when taking in the response for the ReadLine and setting Pizza to pizza or PIZZA and Raiders to raiders or RAIDERS depending on which route you decide to choose. This way it would ensure the user gets the response in case user input isnt exacty Pizza or Raiders. There also needs to be data validation and the play again function would be nice if they had an option to say YES or NO to play again or end the program. Nice job!
